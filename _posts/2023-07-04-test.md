In 2021, I attended Botball robot competition to get in touch and extend my shot on technology. There were two kinds of conference at this competition. The Asian division was taken place in May and the global conference was taken place in August. Due to the pandemic, the competition of Asian division took place in Hangzhou, while the global conference was conducted online.

## Basic introduction about Botball

The Botball Robot Competition is a robotics competition designed for middle and high school students to foster their interest and skills in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education. The competition challenges students to design, build, and program autonomous robots to complete specific tasks and solve complex problems.
The Botball Robot Competition aims to promote hands-on learning, creativity, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities among students. It provides a platform for students to apply their knowledge of robotics, programming, and engineering principles in a competitive and engaging environment.

The competition is organized into teams of students, typically ranging from two to ten members, who collaborate to design and construct their robots. Each team is guided by a teacher or mentor who provides guidance and support throughout the competition.

Participating teams are provided with a robot kit that includes necessary components, such as motors, sensors, and a microcontroller, along with programming software. The kit serves as a foundation for teams to build their robots and program their functionalities.

The competition takes place on a designated game board that features various challenges and missions. These missions require the robots to perform specific tasks autonomously, such as navigating obstacles, picking up objects, following lines, or interacting with the environment in some way. The complexity of the missions increases with higher levels of competition.

Students use programming languages, such as C, C++, or a visual programming environment, to develop the algorithms and instructions for their robots. They must program the robots to make decisions, react to sensor inputs, and execute precise movements to successfully complete the missions within the given time limit.

Teams are encouraged to strategize and optimize their robot's design and programming to achieve higher scores and more efficient performance. Innovative solutions, unique designs, and creative problem-solving approaches are highly valued and recognized.

## Preparation

In January of each year, the organizers of Botball release the mission board for the upcoming year (with adjustments made each year). The competition results are determined based on the final scores obtained by the teams, with higher-scoring teams ranking higher. This means that we have nearly four months of preparation and debugging time before the Asia competition arrives.
Since the competition is held in the form of teams, I and three other classmates from our school who share a passion for robotics have decided to form a team together. We also met an engineer outside of school who agreed to be our mentor and guide us in the process.

Due to the pandemic, although the Asian regional competition was held in Hangzhou, teams from other Asian countries were unable to enter China to participate in the competition due to China's strict quarantine policies. Therefore, only teams from China were present at the venue. In the high school division that I am in, there are a total of 20 teams who will fiercely compete for the championship.
Since the organizers announced new rules and venues in January 2021, these rules have been translated into multiple languages for different regions across continents. In fact, there are some discrepancies between the original English version and the Chinese translated version in certain areas. However, it doesn't matter in the Asian regional competition since all the teams are from China, and everyone has built their robots and planned their paths based on the Chinese version of the rules.

Meanwhile, in order to better prepare for the competition, we decided to rent a house near the school for convenient training after class. We set up a competition field inside the house with a scale of approximately 2.5 * 2.5 meters, following a 1:1 ratio. In the initial stages, our focus was mainly on planning the robot's path. By performing different combinations of tasks, we calculated the potential scores and selected the top three highest-scoring approaches as the three feasible paths.

The organizers provided us with only one sweeping robot as the base. We needed to modify this robot by using LEGO and motors to create a robotic arm that would enable us to accomplish the desired tasks. The organizers specified that the number of motors installed on the robot should not exceed three, and there were size restrictions on the robot as well, prohibiting it from being too large.
My teammates and I designed various mechanical arms for different purposes to address different tasks. However, in the end, due to the time limit of the competition (2 minutes), some of the mechanical arms remained unused as we were unable to complete all the tasks. During the debugging process, our robot encountered various issues. For example, if the battery of the robot had a low charge, it would move too quickly and be unable to accurately perform tasks in the designated positions. On the other hand, insufficient battery power would hinder its performance. To avoid such situations, we prepared multiple batteries for debugging, ensuring that the batteries were not overcharged during the charging process.

Sometimes, sunlight caused reflections that affected the accuracy of the light pole sensors installed on the robot. This led to occasional misidentification and premature progression to the next step. After several months of debugging, our robot successfully completed our planned tasks without any errors for ten consecutive runs. We are confident and fully prepared for the upcoming Asia competition.

# Asian Division

Asian Division took place in Hangzhou, China in May, 2021.When we entered the competition field, we found that the venue set up by the organizers was not level, possibly due to the poor quality of the table. This caused our robot to experience deviations, as the table was tilted and the robot's movement speed was altered, making it difficult to execute tasks effectively. Most tasks on the field involved picking up blocks and transporting them to designated locations to earn points. However, due to the slight deviations caused by the uneven field, our robot was likely unable to grasp the blocks and place them in the appropriate positions. This was especially challenging for tasks that required stacking blocks, as the misalignment of the bottom blocks would cause the entire stack to become skewed, resulting in the collapse of multiple layers of blocks. Our previous efforts would be in vain. Additionally, the varying brightness of the lighting in each field affected the light sensor. The field was constructed with a whiteboard and had several black lines used for robot line following and calibration. In some areas, there were reflections on the black lines, causing the sensor to fail in detecting the black line underneath. As a result, the robot could not reach the intended destination and returned empty-handed. The competition lasted for a day, with the morning dedicated to debugging. My teammates and I divided the work and fine-tuned the robot's code based on the on-site environment. After several attempts, the robot was able to roughly achieve our predetermined goals. Finally, when our robot took the stage, despite the challenges we faced, we managed to score the expected points, fortunately benefiting from a significant mistake made by our opponents' robot in the final round. We maintained a significant lead in the score and successfully secured the championship in the Asian division.

# Global Conference

After completing the Asian division, we had two months to prepare for the international tournament. The venue and rules for both the Asia and international competitions remained the same. However, the international tournament had more teams, with over 70 participating. Due to the pandemic, the competition was conducted online, which meant we only needed to add cameras to our regular training field. We initially thought this was a favorable condition since our programs were developed and fine-tuned based on this field, unlike the Asia competition where we were affected by on-site lighting and slight variations in field dimensions.
Soon, the first round of the competition concluded, and our robot successfully followed our planned path and completed all the predetermined tasks. However, when the referees calculated the scores, there was a significant discrepancy between the results based on the calculation method we used, following the Chinese version of the rules, and the referees' scoring. At first, we believed the referees made a mistake and contacted the organizers of the Chinese region to report the issue. With only one hour remaining until the second round of the competition, the Chinese organizers replied, acknowledging that there were indeed discrepancies between the Chinese version of the rules and the original English version (translation errors occurred). We then compared the two versions and confirmed the differences.
During the remaining hour, we were filled with anxiety. We considered changing our strategy and attempting different tasks, but that would require rewriting and adjusting the program, which was unrealistic to accomplish within an hour. However, we still decided to give it a try. Before attempting the new plan, we made a backup of the original code to ensure that even if the new approach didn't work well, we could still retain the original scores. Time flew by in the blink of an eye during that hour, and we had barely finished writing the new program, without any testing. In the end, we chose to stick with the original plan and lost to our opponents in the quarter-finals, ultimately receiving a second prize.

## Conclusion

In this competition, I have gained a lot of life experience, including the early stage of team integration, the collision of thoughts during discussions, and most importantly, the ability to adapt on the spot, not becoming blank-minded or helpless in unexpected situations. At the same time, I have also formed deep friendships with my teammates.
